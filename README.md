# Sample SVG Icon usage for Vue.js

A demo to show how I prefer to set up an SVG icon system in Vue.js. You can see <a href="https://sdras.github.io/vue-sample-svg-icons/">a demo live here</a>. You don't have to do it this way, it's an opinionated example. More details for _why_ it's set up in this manner in the [Vue Cookbook](https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/editable-svg-icons.html).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
